## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Centralized validation logic using traits
- Shared components across different contexts
- Configuration-driven implementations

### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose
- Open/Closed: Easy to extend without modifying existing code
- Dependency Inversion: Abstractions over concretions

### Laravel Best Practices
- Form Request classes for validation
- Action classes for business logic
- Resource classes for API responses
- Policy classes for authorization

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. **Design**: Follow established patterns and principles
2. **Implement**: Use existing traits and base classes where possible
3. **Test**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. **Document**: Update relevant documentation

### Refactoring Guidelines
1. **Identify Duplication**: Look for repeated code patterns
2. **Extract Common Logic**: Create traits or base classes
3. **Maintain Flexibility**: Use configuration parameters
4. **Preserve Type Safety**: Maintain full type hints

## 📝 Code Standards

### File Organization
- **Traits**: `app/Http/Requests/Concerns/`
- **Form Requests**: `app/Http/Requests/` (Web) or `app/Http/Requests/API/` (API)
- **Actions**: `app/Actions/`
- **Resources**: `app/Http/Resources/`

### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase with descriptive names
- **Methods**: camelCase with clear purpose
- **Variables**: camelCase with meaningful names
- **Files**: Match class names exactly

### Documentation Requirements
- **PHPDoc**: All public methods must have documentation
- **Type Hints**: Full type hints for parameters and return types
- **Examples**: Include usage examples in documentation
- **Changelog**: Document significant changes

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Test Organization
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/Unit/`
- **Feature Tests**: `tests/Feature/`
- **Integration Tests**: For complex workflows

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum**: 80% code coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for business logic
- **Edge Cases**: Test error conditions and boundaries

## 🔄 Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
- **Category Request Classes**: Apply DRY principles to category validation
- **Transaction Request Classes**: Centralize transaction validation logic
- **API Response Standardization**: Create consistent response helpers
- **Error Handling Improvement**: Centralized error response formatting

### Technical Debt
- **Legacy Code**: Gradual refactoring of older components
- **Performance**: Optimize slow queries and endpoints
- **Security**: Regular security audits and updates
